# Example Kore configuration

# Below you will find all available configuration
# options for Kore. Options which have a default value
# and can be left out of the configuration are commented
# out with their default value specified.

# Maximum length to queue pending connections (see listen(2))
# MUST be set before any bind directive.
#socket_backlog			5000

# Server configuration.
bind		127.0.0.1 443

# The path key manager process will chroot into after starting.
keymgr_chroot	/home/joris/src/kore

# The key manager process will run as the specified user.
keymgr_runas	keymgr

# The path worker processes will chroot into after starting.
chroot		/home/joris/src/kore

# Worker processes will run as the specified user.
runas		joris

# How many worker processes Kore will spawn. If the directive
# worker_set_affinity is set to 1 (the default) Kore will automatically
# pin these worker processes to different CPU cores in your system.
# NOTE: If you set this to the maximum number of cores you have
# in your system (or more) you might consider turning off affinity
# if you are running CPU heavy services on the same machine.
workers		4

# The number of active connections each worker can handle.
# You might have to tweak this number based on your hardware.
#worker_max_connections		250

# Limit of maximum open files per worker.
#worker_rlimit_nofiles		1024

# Limit the number of new connections a worker can accept
# in a single event loop. By default Kore will accept as
# many new connections it can up to worker_max_connections.
#
# NOTE: If you are running benchmark tools that throw all
# connections at Kore at the same time (when they are less
# then worker_max_connections) or you have an actual reason
# to not spend too much time in the accept loop this setting
# will make a HUGE positive difference.
#
# This is disabled by default. If you wish to enable this
# specify the number of connections a worker will accept
# before returning from the accept loop.
#worker_accept_threshold		0

# Workers bind themselves to a single CPU by default.
# Turn this off by setting this option to 0
#worker_set_affinity		1

# Store the pid of the main process in this file.
#pidfile	kore.pid

# If TLS is enabled you can specify a file where Kore will read
# initial entropy from and save entropy towards when exiting.
#
# Note that if you enable this you must provide the first iteration
# of this file by generating 1024 cryptographically safe random bytes
# and writing them to the file specified.
#
# Kore will refuse to start if the specified file does not exist,
# is of the wrong size or cannot be opened in anyway.
#
# NOTE: This file location must be inside your chrooted environment.
#rand_file	random.data

# HTTP specific settings.
#	http_header_max		Maximum size of HTTP headers (in bytes).
#
#	http_body_max		Maximum size of an HTTP body (in bytes).
#				If set to 0 disallows requests with a body
#				all together.
#
#	http_body_disk_offload	Number of bytes after which Kore will use
#				a temporary file to hold the HTTP body
#				instead of holding it in memory. If set to
#				0 no disk offloading will be done. This is
#				turned off by default.
#
#	http_body_disk_path	Path where Kore will store any temporary
#				HTTP body files.
#
#	http_keepalive_time	Maximum seconds an HTTP connection can be
#				kept alive by the browser.
#				(Set to 0 to disable keepalive completely).
#
#	http_hsts_enable	Send Strict Transport Security header in
#				all responses. Parameter is the age.
#				(Set to 0 to disable sending this header).
#
#	http_request_limit	Limit the number of HTTP requests workers
#				can queue up.
#
#	http_request_ms		The number of milliseconds workers can max
#				spend inside the HTTP processing loop.
#
#http_header_max	4096

# Authentication configuration
#
# Using authentication blocks you can define a standard way for
# Kore to validate your users. In the example below we create
# a authentication block called auth_example, which requires
# a cookie (session_id) to be set.
#
# If no cookie is present or the cookie is not valid according
# to the set validator, Kore will redirect the browser to the
# URI set in authentication_uri.
#
# Page handlers can be bound to authentication by specifying
# authentication block at the end of the page directive (see below).
authentication auth_example {
	# The authentication type denotes the way the user should
	# be authenticated.
	#
	# Allow values:
	#	- cookie (checks for the cookie presence + pass to validator)
	#	- header (checks for header presence + pass to validator)
	#	- request (passes the http_request to the validator)
	#
	# Use cases for request could for example be IP based ACLs or
	# any other criteria that can be extracted from a http_request.
	#
	# The request type does not need an authentication_validator.
	#
	authentication_type		cookie

	# The name of whatever we are looking for.
	authentication_value		session_id

	# The validator that will be called to verify the cookie.
	# Note this is YOUR validator, Kore does not have built-in
	# session support. You must add this manually using your
	# preferred method (Storing it in postgres, redis, ...)
	authentication_validator	v_session

	# The URI Kore will redirect to if a authentication fails.
	# If this is not set, Kore will return a simple 403.
	authentication_uri		/private
}

# Domain configuration
#
# Each domain configuration starts with listing what domain
# the directives that follow are to be applied upon.
#
# Additionally you can specify the following in a domain configuration:
#
#	accesslog
#		- File where all requests are logged.
#	client_certificates [CA] [optional CRL]
#		- Require client certificates to be sent for the given
#		  CA with an optional CRL file.
#
# Handlers
#
# Handlers are either static (for fixed paths) or dynamic.
# Dynamic handlers take a POSIX regular expression as its path.
#
# Syntax:
#	handler		path		module_callback		[auth block]
#
# Note that the auth block is optional and if set will force Kore to
# authenticate the user according to the authentication block its settings
# before allowing access to the page.

# Example domain that responds to localhost.
