About
-----

Kore 4.3.0 (https://kore.io) is a web application platform for writing scalable,
concurrent web based processes in C or Python.

It is built with a "secure by default" approach. It is fully privilege
separated while using strong security features at the operating system level
such as seccomp, pledge, unveil and more.

Today Kore is used in a variety of applications ranging from high assurance
cryptographic devices, machine-learning stacks and even in the aerospace
industry.

From embedded platforms all the way to high performance servers. *Kore scales.*

Key Features
